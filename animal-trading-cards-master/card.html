			<p class="Fact">The bald eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782.
				It was chosen for its majestic appearance and representation of freedom and strength.
When it comes to sight, eagles have two centers of focus. This gives them the ability to see forward and to the side simultaneously.</p>

			<p>The bald eagle's scientific name signifies a sea (halo) eagle (aeetos)
				 with a white (leukos) head. At one time, the word "bald" meant "white,"
				 not hairless. Bald eagles are found throughout most of North America,
				 from Alaska and Canada to northern Mexico.</p>
